To change which hosts can access the database change:
/etc/mysql/my.cnf -> binding address. 0.0.0.0 for public, 127.0.0.1 for local

To allow remote users into the database use the following example:
mysql> CREATE USER 'monty'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@'%'
    ->     WITH GRANT OPTION;
